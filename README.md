# Path Racer

This is a react-based screensaver generated by GPT-4.  Two characters (blue and green) race eachother to the destination.

## Creation

The original prompt I supplied the model is available in [prompt.txt](prompt.txt)

There was some minimal additional prompting to get the target to glow and the info button in the top left.

## Running
This game will run like any other create-react-app

```
npm i
npm run start
```
